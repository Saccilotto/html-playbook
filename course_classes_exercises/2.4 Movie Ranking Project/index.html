<h1>The Best Movies According to Andr√©</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies until now</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Mushishi</h3>
<p>This series/movie is one of a few that keeps you relaxed and entertained at the same time.<br>
It also comes with a great soundtrack and a beautiful art style. It also delivers a sense of mistery<br>
and spirituality that is hard to find in other series.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Wolf Children</h3>
<p>This movie is a masterpiece. It's a story about a mother and her children, and how they grow up.<br>
It's a story about love, loss, and how to deal with it. It's a story about life.<br>
The movie can make you truly feel the characters' emotions, and it's a great experience.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Princess Mononoke</h3>
<p>A story of an ancient scenario with fantastic creatures and new emerging civilizations.<br>
In this context, we meet a wild girl who grew with the wolves. Her fight for nature and the<br>
spirits of the forest against the corrupting civilization makes for a great plot.</p>
